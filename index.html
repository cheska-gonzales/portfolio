        <h2><b>ABOUT ME</b></h2>
        <p> I am Francheska Gonzales, currently a third year college student taking up
            Bachelor of Arts in Multimedia Arts at De La Salle - College of Saint Benilde. Back in 2012, I gained
            interest in photography when I became a church photographer and when I entered college, making illustrations
            had caught my attention. This is a broad course which in turn gave me the room to improve and revamp my
            skills as well as discover my potentials as I can explore and combine various art forms and new media
            technologies to create quality contents. Moreover, I had the chance to express myself through art in
            divergent mediums so choosing to take this course offers a path to capture inspiration and creativity.</p>

                <p>The posters below were done in year 2020 up to the first quarter of 2021. This enabled me to
                    exercise my creativity while spending time at home in the course of this pandemic. During stressful
                    days I thought of a way to exert my efforts on my hobbies.
